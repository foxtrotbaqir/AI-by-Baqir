In this independent research project, I embarked on the task of fortifying the security of Internet of Things (IoT) applications within the healthcare sector, commonly referred to as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The objective was to ensure the seamless and secure delivery of personalized (e)-health services to patients while addressing the growing concerns related to security and privacy breaches.

To achieve this, I employed a cutting-edge approach involving the integration of hyper-parameter optimized Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. These models were trained on a representative Anomaly Intrusion Detection System (AIDS) dataset, which mirrors contemporary cyber-attacks on IoMT networks. To tackle class imbalance issues within the dataset, I leveraged the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) Algorithm. The crucial process of optimizing model parameters was conducted through the Random search algorithm. Throughout the project, I developed six state-of-the-art ML and DL architectures to comprehensively assess their performance in enhancing security.

The results obtained from this project revealed significant advancements in security measures for IoMT systems. The models exhibited remarkable accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics in detecting normal operations. Notably, the Random Forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models emerged as top performers in terms of overall accuracy. However, the project also identified areas for improvement, particularly in the Deep Learning models, where due to computational constraints, we could only train for a single epoch. As a recommendation for future work, I propose further exploration with extended training epochs to realize the full potential of DL models and facilitate a more equitable comparison with ML counterparts.
